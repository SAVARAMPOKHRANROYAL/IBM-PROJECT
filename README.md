Air pollution is a significant environmental challenge that adversely impacts human health and ecosystems worldwide. Traditional monitoring methods provide limited spatial coverage and real-time data, making it challenging to effectively address this issue. However, machine learning (ML) techniques offer promising solutions for predicting and monitoring air pollution. By leveraging ML algorithms and large datasets, researchers can develop accurate models capable of forecasting air pollution levels and identifying potential sources. These predictive models have the potential to assist policymakers, urban planners, and individuals in making informed decisions to mitigate the harmful effects of air pollution and improve air quality in a timely manner. In this article, we explore the application of ML in air pollution prediction, highlighting its benefits and challenges for effective environmental management.
